# wmo-parser
A library that can be used to parse various World Meteorological Organization (WMO) text files
published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Hurricane
Center (NHC) into usable objects or JSON. NOTE: This is not an official NWS/WMO library.

TODO: More documentation to come as library develops
